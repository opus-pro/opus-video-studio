name: media-tools
description: Call individual Opus media tools or models for speech, music, sound effects, images/keyframes, transcription, asset import, and job status or recovery. New video generation always goes through video-director, even for a direct model request. Use motion-ui for local UI animation and code-driven video.

# Media Tools

Fulfill the requested media operation without adding a video production workflow or a local animation project.

## Scope and shared rules

- Resolve the plugin root from a valid `AO_HARNESS_ROOT`, otherwise from this file's `<harness-root>/skills/media-tools/SKILL.md` path. Read root `AGENTS.md` for the public allowlist, updates, identity, approvals, idempotency, storage, and recovery rules.
- Audio, images/keyframes, transcription, import, and existing-job queries belong here. A request to generate any new video clip belongs to `skills/video-director/SKILL.md`, regardless of model, clip count, or whether the user supplied a prompt. A video status query does not require Director planning again.
- Use only the live `opus-video-tools` schema and available model metadata. Honor the requested model if exposed and compatible. Do not invent model names or fields, use private provider scripts, or silently substitute an unavailable model.
- Do not load the Seedance skillpack for independent audio or images, require a video storyboard, add camera directions to speech, or create a Remotion project for an assets-only request.

## Execute the requested operation

1. Identify the desired output and input/reference roles. Use `generate_audio` for speech, music, or sound effects; `generate_keyframes` for images; `transcribe_audio` for timing/text; and `import_assets` for asset registration, according to the live schema. Use `get_status`, `list_jobs`, and `resolve_job` for existing work.
2. Verify `opus_video_tools_whoami` before new project creation, complete host sign-in if needed, and resolve an unexpected organization. Bind new generation/storage work to an explicit backend project. Status and recovery use the original job/project context instead of creating another project. Never reuse a previous organization's assets after switching organizations.
3. Prepare a review artifact appropriate to the medium: exact text, language, and voice for speech; a brief and duration for music/SFX; prompt, dimensions/aspect, and reference usage for images; input and desired operation for transcription/import. State requested outputs and the paid request count where relevant. Do not fabricate prices or require absent video layers. Follow shared paid approval rules; preserve the scope of an already approved request.
4. Save each exposed `requestKey` as a UUID together with the exact arguments before submitting project creation or generation/transcription. Preserve the key for an identical retry only. Changed work needs a new key and, when paid, a new bound approval. Finish any returned asset upload/finalization steps before using its durable reference.
5. Submit only the requested operations. Poll asynchronous jobs with `get_status`, using watch windows of at most 45 seconds or ordinary polling, until completed, failed, or submission_unknown. Continue across timed-out watch windows without resubmitting paid work. Resolve unknown submissions only under the shared explicit duplicate-spend-risk procedure.
6. Deliver the actual completed audio, image, transcript, or asset reference using the host's supported media presentation. Save durable project/job/asset IDs and exact request records. Do not claim a mix, preview, or export that was not produced and verified. Further editing or local assembly occurs only when requested.
