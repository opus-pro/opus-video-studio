name: human-realism
description: Improve realistic person image and video assets with believable skin, hair, hands, identity anchors, restrained body motion, and natural speech cues. Use when a selected workflow includes real-looking people, realistic avatars, person anchors, model sheets, first/last frames, or human output that should feel less polished and less AI-looking.

# Human Realism

Use these rules when the goal is a believable person, not a polished commercial model. They are
usually loaded by `helpers/human-realism/HELPER.md` as an auto helper and apply only to
realistic-person assets/shots inside the current primary workflow.

## Core Rule

Do not prompt for a perfect person. Prompt for an ordinary captured person with visible evidence:
skin texture, small asymmetries, loose hair, real lighting, phone-camera behavior, restrained
movement, micro-expressions, natural blinks, modest mouth shapes, and conversational room audio.

Avoid turning the asset into cinematic beauty advertising unless the user explicitly asks for that.

## Helper Workflow

1. Inspect all person, product, room, outfit, and voice references.
2. Track each input as used-HOW or unused-WHY.
3. Decide whether the job needs:
   - person identity anchor
   - model sheet
   - product-hold first frame
   - last frame
   - human realism constraints on selected video prompts
4. Add human-realism constraints to the primary workflow's storyboard/asset plan.
5. Open the plan gate before paid image or video calls.
6. Generate or select anchors only after plan approval.
7. Show generated/selected anchors and first/last frames before paid video.
8. Keep the primary workflow in charge of video mode, clip count, dialogue timing, audio route, and
   render decisions.
9. Open the preview gate with deviations and realism risks.

## Image Asset Strategy

Use a model sheet when identity must survive product holds, close-ups, or multiple clips.

Minimum model sheet:

- front medium portrait
- slight left close-up
- slight right close-up
- side/profile view when the face will turn
- hands/product-hold frame when the product matters

For a one-off realistic person clip, a single approved first frame plus optional last frame is
usually enough.

## Human Realism Prompt Block

Add this style block to person stills unless it conflicts with the user's reference:

```text
Real smartphone UGC photograph, unretouched, natural skin texture, visible pores, mild redness,
fine lines, natural oil, minor imperfections, subtle asymmetry, baby hairs, stray hairs, real hair
texture, relaxed facial expression with tiny asymmetry, ordinary posture, soft natural daylight or
direct phone flash, realistic contrast, neutral color rendering, organic sharpness, slight digital
grain, no beauty filter, no airbrushing, not polished, not cinematic, not fashion editorial.
```

Use negative constraints when the provider supports them:

```text
No flawless plastic skin, no airbrushed face, no beauty filter, no glossy commercial lighting,
no perfect teeth/smile unless requested, no over-sharpened eyes, no waxy skin, no warped hands,
no extra fingers, no deformed product, no morphing, no fake studio backdrop, no exaggerated mouth
movement, no puppet-like lip flaps.
```

## Model Sheet Prompt Pattern

```text
Create a realistic human identity model sheet for the same person across all views.
Keep the same face, age, body type, skin tone, hair color, hair texture, outfit, and expression.
Use unretouched smartphone realism: visible pores, mild redness, fine lines, natural oil, small
imperfections, baby hairs, stray hairs, relaxed posture, natural hands.

Views:
1. front medium portrait, relaxed arms
2. slight left close-up, nose/eyes/lips visible
3. slight right close-up, nose/eyes/lips visible
4. left profile or three-quarter profile
5. right profile or three-quarter profile
6. hands holding <product> naturally, product shape and text preserved

Lighting: <room light / window light / phone flash>.
Background: <plain room / bedroom / bathroom / gym / coffee shop>.
Camera: smartphone lens, eye level, slight handheld imperfection.
```

## Product-Hold First Frame Pattern

```text
Ultra-realistic smartphone UGC first frame. The same person from the approved anchor is <sitting /
standing> in <location>, facing the phone camera. They hold <product> naturally near <face/chest>,
with relaxed fingers and believable grip. Preserve product shape, logo/text, color, and scale.
Expression is neutral and casual, not a posed ad smile. Real skin texture, pores, mild redness,
baby hairs, stray hairs, natural daylight, slight digital grain, no retouching, no beauty filter.
```

## Video Realism Prompt Pattern

Merge this into the selected primary workflow's video prompt when realistic human motion or voice is
in scope. The primary workflow still owns video mode, timing, and audio route.

```text
Style: ultra-realistic captured human video, calm and natural, understated, social-media native
when appropriate.

Use the first reference image as the starting frame. If a last reference is provided, end close to
that pose without morphing. Keep the same person, outfit, product, lighting, skin texture, room, and
camera perspective.

Motion: subtle handheld phone movement, small natural head movement, relaxed shoulders, casual
product gesture, natural blinks, tiny micro-expressions, slight eye shifts, short pauses, no rushed
actions, no cuts, no morphing, no theatrical acting.

Face and mouth when dialogue is in scope: natural lip-sync, modest jaw movement, restrained mouth
shapes, no exaggerated lip flaps, no puppet mouth, no over-wide smile unless scripted.

Audio when dialogue is in scope: natural room-recorded voice with a defined personality
(age/accent/timbre/pitch/pace/energy), casual conversational tone, small breaths and natural pauses,
room tone based on the image, no music unless requested, not a professional voiceover.
```

## Voice Realism

When the primary workflow uses native video audio:

- Write exact dialogue in the video prompt.
- Define voice personality: age feel, language/accent, timbre, pitch, pace, energy, emotional
  baseline, and cadence.
- Keep total speech short enough for the duration.
- Ask for "casual conversational tone" and "room-recorded voice."
- Include "small breaths and natural pauses" only when the delivery should feel candid.
- Constrain mouth behavior: natural lip-sync, modest jaw movement, no exaggerated mouth movement.
- Use "no music" unless the user explicitly asks for a soundtrack.

When the primary workflow uses separate audio fallback:

- Generate one voice per speaker.
- Keep it conversational, not announcer-like.
- Render the audio with the video only after disclosing lip-sync risk in the plan gate.

## Realism Checklist

Before paid video, verify the approved plan contains:

- exact identity source and anchor images
- exact product references and product text/logos to preserve
- first frame and optional last frame
- voice personality tied to the person anchor when dialogue is in scope
- one small action per beat
- exact dialogue split by time window
- negative constraints for over-polishing and deformation

Preview gate should explicitly report:

- skin texture: preserved, softened, or failed
- hair edges: natural or too clean
- hands/product: preserved or deformed
- micro-expression/blinks/pauses: natural or stiff
- movement: subtle or overacted
- voice: conversational or synthetic/announcer-like
- lip sync and mouth shape: understated/acceptable, exaggerated, or risky

## Safety Notes

Do not impersonate a real person unless the user provided or owns the reference and explicitly asks
to preserve that identity. Do not claim a synthetic testimonial is from a real customer unless the
user has approved that representation.
